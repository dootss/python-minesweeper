# python-minesweeper

A clean, smooth, and aesthetic Minesweeper game implemented in Python using tkinter. This project relies solely on Python's base modules, requiring no additional dependencies beyond a standard Python installation.
Made with the intent of looking nice and being easy to setup & play.

## Features

- **Multiple Difficulty Levels**: Choose from Beginner, Intermediate, or Expert levels to match your skill.
- **Highscores Tracking**: Records your best times in a file for each difficulty level, allowing you to track your progress and achievements.
- **Chording**: Allows you to quickly reveal adjacent cells when the number of flags around a numbered cell matches its number.
- **Safe First Click**: The first cell clicked will never be a mine, ensuring a fair start to each game.
- **Imageless Aesthetics**: The game runs entirely using one file, no images or requirements.
